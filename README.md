## Requirements

1. Frontend Technologies: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a framework like React.js) and Mongo DB for Database.

## Usage

1. Setup your MongoDB connection by creating the `.env` file in your `server` directory with your MongoDB URL
   
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    echo 'dbURL="your_mongodb_uri_here"' > .env
    ```
3. Start the server
    ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Start the frontend (in a separate terminal)
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
